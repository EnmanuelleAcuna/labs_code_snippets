## Coding concepts (C# and Java)

### Operators
- assigment =
- comparing (equals to) ==
- not equals !=
- math operations +, -, *, /
- pre-incrementation ++variable
- post-incrementation variable++
- greater and less than > <, greather than or equal to and less than or equal to >= <=
- operations with assigment +=, -+, *=, /=
- module operator (remainer) %
- ternary operator ?: example: recipient = condition ? true : false;
- logical operators and: &&, or: ||, not: !

### Classes
Blueprints to create an object, classes can contain data members (constant/variables) and methods/functions
- default constructor: initiate all values
- classes support inheritance and polymorphism.
- classes are a reference type.

### Access
- public class: can be accessed anyhwhere o nthe project
- public data members/methods: can be accessed anywhere in the class and where the class was instantiated.
- private data members/methods: can be accessed in the class only

### Abstract class
- Cannot be instantiated, can contain abstract methods but it is not required, can contain no abstract methods

### Virtual clasess
- Can be changed in classes that derive from the base class

### Structures
- Are similar to classes in the way that they can have public and private datamembers and functions/methods.
- Structures are a value type.
